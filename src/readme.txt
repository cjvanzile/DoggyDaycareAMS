Database Demonstration Instructions
-----------------------------------
1. Place "phase4.jar" and "dogs.txt" files in the same directory.
2. Change to directory containing jar and txt files.
3. Type "java -jar phase4.jar" to run the program.
4. Leaving "dogs.db" in the database file text box, will create the database in the same directory.
5. Clicking on the "Import Data" button in the upper left will import the "dogs.txt" file into the database.

Notes:
- If the dog database is present, it will automatically be read.
- If the dog database is not present, it will be created with no dogs.
- Dogs can be imported from "dogs.txt" using the instructions above.
- If the program is rerun, the database will already contain dogs.
