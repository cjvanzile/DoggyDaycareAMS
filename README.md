# Doggy Daycare Attendance Management System

## Description

### Introduction
The Doggy Daycare AMS is a command-line application designed for managing the attendance and care details of dogs at a daycare business.  
Staff members can add, remove, update, display, and batch-import dog records, as well as generate an attendance and food needs report.

### Requirements Definition
Daycare staff need to keep accurate records of each dog, including: unique ID, name, breed, date of birth, food type, gender, spay/neuter status, and check-in status.  
Staff must be able to add, remove, update, and display dogs individually, and load a group of dogs from a text file.  
The system must also provide an attendance report that lists all checked-in dogs and summarizes food requirements.

## Concepts
This program demonstrates using a console-based menu to manage dog records for a daycare, including data validation, batch loading from a text file, and a custom attendance report that lists all checked-in dogs and their food needs.

## Objectives

- The system is fully console-based; all interaction happens in the terminal.
- Staff interact with an on-screen menu to manage dogs.
- Each dog record contains:
  - Unique integer ID
  - Name
  - Breed
  - Date of Birth (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Food Type (0 = no food, 1 = dry, 2 = wet, 3 = customer provided)
  - Gender (M/F)
  - Spayed/Neutered status (U, Y, N)
  - Checked-In status (true/false)
- The system can import dogs from a text file (comma-separated values).
- Staff can manually add, update, and remove dogs.
- All dog records can be displayed at any time.
- The system generates a report listing all checked-in dogs and a food breakdown.
- Data is stored in memory during runtime (no database or GUI in Phase 1).

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
- Dog information: id, name, breed, date of birth, food type, gender, spayed/neutered status, and checked-in status.
- Text file with lines formatted as:  
  `id,name,breed,dob,food,gender,spayedNeutered,checkedIn`

### Outputs
- List of all dogs with their information.
- Attendance report showing checked-in dogs and food type totals.

## Phase 4 - Database Demonstration Instructions

1. Place "phase4.jar" and "dogs.txt" files in the same directory.
2. Change to directory containing jar and txt files.
3. Type "java -jar phase4.jar" to run the program.
4. Leaving "dogs.db" in the database file text box, will create the database in the same directory.
5. Clicking on the "Import Data" button in the upper left will import the "dogs.txt" file into the database.

### Notes

- If the dog database is present, it will automatically be read.
- If the dog database is not present, it will be created with no dogs.
- Dogs can be imported from "dogs.txt" using the instructions above.
- If the program is rerun, the database will already contain dogs.
